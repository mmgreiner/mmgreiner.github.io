## Websharper Shopping cart

I found an interesting article from 2020 by Adam Granizc on the implementation of a WebSharper shopping cart in [WebSharper Shopping Cart](https://github.com/intellifactory/blogs/blob/master/user/granicz/20201231-variations-for-a-websharper-shopping-cart.md)

Unfortunately, the code was not published, and as an exercise, I wanted to re-implement it in two ways:

- as shown in the article using the reactive UI
- as an elmish MVU implementation

I found the code later in [github](https://github.com/websharper-samples/ShoppingCart). Starting from there, I'm working on int in [github]({{exercise_link}}).
