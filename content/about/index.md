A Swiss nick name for Markus is Küse, and since I love alliterations, this blog is called Küse’s Code.

It contains a collection of code snippets, and demonstrates my various interest, starting with functional programming
in [F#] and [Go]({{< param "go_link" >}}), and web programming 
in [WebSharper]({{< param "websharper_link" >}}) or [Bolero]({{< param "bolero_link" >}}), and Elm.

This blog was originally written as a static HTML site using [Jekyll]({{< param "jekyll_link" >}}), and later moved 
to [Hugo]({{<param "hugo_link">}}).
