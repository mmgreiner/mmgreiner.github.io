## Idea

[Protocol buffers][protobuf] are a standard data exchange protocol defined and heavily used by Google.

> Protocol Buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanisms for serializing structured data.

The recommended approach is to define data structures (called *messages*) in the protobuf language and then generate code stubs for C++, Java, C#, Python, Go, etc.

However, in many cases we are faced with existing modules in Python, C++, Java, .etc and want to interface to them from another programming languages. So we would need to generate the protobuf descriptions based on existing packages.

## Python to Protobuf

This article https://dzone.com/articles/python-reflection-how-to-list-modules-and-inspect describes how to get the classes, methods, and packages from an existing Python module.
