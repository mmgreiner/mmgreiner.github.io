## Model Content Protocol (MCP)

According to [mcp]
> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by language models. Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying databases, calling APIs, or performing computations. Each tool is uniquely identified by a name and includes metadata describing its schema.

## Available ruby gems

[fast-mcp] is a 
> Connect AI models to your Ruby applications with ease
>
> No complex protocols, no integration headaches, no compatibility issues – just beautiful, expressive Ruby code.

[tiny-mcp] is 
> A tiny Ruby implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that makes it easy to create and serve tools locally for AI assistants.

[rubyllm-mcp] is 
> A Ruby client for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that seamlessly integrates with RubyLLM. This gem enables Ruby applications to connect to MCP servers and use their tools, resources, and prompts as part of LLM conversations.

[ruby-sdk] is
> The official Ruby SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients.

[mcp-on-rails] is
> A Rails application template that seamlessly integrates the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropics/model-context-protocol) with Ruby on Rails applications using the [mcp][ruby-sdk] gem.

## [MCP-on-rails][mcp-on-rails] 

I haved worked with [mcp-on-rails]. It is very easy to start this template:

~~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/pstrzalk/mcp-on-rails.git
rails new myapp -m mcp-on-rails/mcp
cd myapp
~~~~

The rails application now has
- MCP server endpoint at `/mcp` as a streamable HTTP transport
- Automatic MCP tool generation when scaffolding
- Necessary MCP infrastructure configured
