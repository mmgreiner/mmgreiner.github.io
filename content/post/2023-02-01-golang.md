In 2023, I became interested in the programming language [Go]. It is a C derivates without all the nil pointer exceptions, and has a very solid infrastructure and libraries to compile across different operating systems.

Nevertheless, it has some quirks which I would like to keep here as a fast reference and cheat sheet.

## Date formats

This is my opinion is the worse design decision they have taken. Formatting times and dates is not done using letters, but numbers. 

A good summary is given in [Go Samples], here as a quick sheet:

- `01` - month
- `02` - day
- `03` - hour (12h)
- `04` - minute
- `05` - second
- `06` - year
- `07` - time zone offset
- `January` - month as long text
- `Jan` - month as short text
- `Monday` - weekday as long text
- `Mon` - weekday as short text

Some standard layouts are useful (taken from [Go Samples])

~~~~go
const (
  // YYYY-MM-DD: 2022-03-23
  YYYYMMDD = "2006-01-02"
  // 24h hh:mm:ss: 14:23:20
  HHMMSS24h = "15:04:05"
  // 12h hh:mm:ss: 2:23:20 PM
  HHMMSS12h = "3:04:05 PM"
  // text date: March 23, 2022
  TextDate = "January 2, 2006"
  // text date with weekday: Wednesday, March 23, 2022
  TextDateWithWeekday = "Monday, January 2, 2006"
  // abbreviated text date: Mar 23 Wed
  AbbrTextDate = "Jan 2 Mon"
)
~~~~


## Enum types

[Go] does not support enum types, but they can be simulated. Again, take a look at [Gosamples enum](https://gosamples.dev/enum/) for a good overview.

~~~go
type Season int

const (
	Spring Season = iota + 1
	Summer
	Autumn
	Winter
)
~~~

The `iota` indicator (I have no clue where this word is coming from) just numbers the constant values 1, 2, 3, ...

Note that when such an enum is marshalled, you have to provide custom marshaller and demarshaller.


## Generics

Generics are parameterized types in Go. Some background can be found in the [tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics).


## Embedding

Files can be embedded in the generated binary. See <>.

~~~~go
import embed
//go:embed: myfiles
res embed.FS
~~~~

If you use file embedding with templates, proceed as follows to embed files in the sub-folder `templates`:

~~~go
import (
  "embed"
  "html/templates"
  "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var (
  //go:embed templates/*
  templFolder embed.FS
  tmplFiles = template.Must(template.ParseFS(templFolder, "templates/index.html", "templates/jobinfo.html", "templates/jobinfo.md"))
)

func main() {
  router := gin.Default()
  router.SetHTMLTemplate(tmplFiles)

  router.GET("/index", func (c *gin.Context) {
    c.HTML(http.StatusOK, "index.html", gin.H{
		  "title": "My title",
	})

  router.Run()
}
~~~

## Code generation

Code can be generated during a go build. See [Go generate](https://go.dev/blog/generate).

~~~go
//go:generate goyacc -o gopher.go -p parser gopher.y
~~~

## Swagger

[Swagger](https://swagger.io) is a standardized way to document REST APIs. In [Go] is is supported by [swaggo/swag]. A good documentation and example can be found at [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/documenting-go-web-apis-with-swag/).

[swaggo/swag] supports either generating [Go] code from swagger specifications, or annotating Go code with special documentation tags and generate the Swagger interface from the code.

## Functional language

[Go] is not a functional language. Some attempts have been made to bring in some functional concepts into it:

- [Github rp-go](https://github.com/IBM/fp-go/tree/main): I found this one promising and well explained
- Functional Programming with Go-Lang: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/BooleanCat/go-functional>
