## Introduction

The podcast [The Rest is Politics - Leading]() always brings longer interviews with persons from politics, social sciences, even sports. The episode just before christmas was called: [Faith, Depression, and Finding Calm in the Chaos (Professor Mark Williams)][Episode 167]. 

> From Parliament to Prison, how can people find calm in chaotic environments? How does one cope with grief during the festive period? What are some successful ways to combat depression? 
>
> Rory and Alastair are joined by clinical psychologist and ordained Minister, Mark Williams, to answer all these questions and more. 

## Meditations

Mark Williams has layed down his thought also in the book [Mindfullness - Finding peace in a frantic world](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/593920/mindfulness-by-mark-williams-and-danny-penman-foreword-by-jon-kabat-zinn/9781609618957). This book contains 8 meditations which can be found in the [Mindfulness and Meditation Guides](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/mindfulness-meditation-downloads/).

Unfortunately, listening to those meditations always pops up a new browser window, which makes it very cumbersome on a mobile device. In addition, they are not grouped per week.

These meditations are all &copy; [Penguin Random House](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/).
