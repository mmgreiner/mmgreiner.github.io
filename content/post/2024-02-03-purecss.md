[Pure.css] is a css framework that does not include JavaScript like other frameworks such as Vue, bootstrap, ...

In contrast to those frameworks:

>> Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at **3.5KB minified and gzipped**. Crafted with mobile devices in mind, it was important to us to keep our file sizes small, and every line of CSS was carefully considered. 

I like it because of its extremely simple usage, particulary for the small development web servers I'm working in *Ruby* or *go*.

I have only had some quirks with it when designing responsive menus for mobile devices. There is a [story on that]({{< relref "/post/2024-07-27-purecss-menu.md" >}}).

## Adding pure.css in Rails

There are two ways to add [Pure.css] to your rails application:

- adding the style sheet link
- adding the asset


### Stylesheet

To add the link to the stylesheet on CDN, use this line:

~~~~html
<head>
    <title>My Title</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= csp_meta_tag %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", "data-turbo-track": "reload" %>
    <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/purecss@3.0.0/build/pure-min.css" integrity="sha384-X38yfunGUhNzHpBaEBsWLO+A0HDYOQi8ufWDkZ0k9e0eXz/tH3II7uKZ9msv++Ls" crossorigin="anonymous">
</head>
~~~~


### Asset

To add it as an asset, do the following.

1. Add the following lines to the asset initializer

~~~~ruby
# config/initializers/assets.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( pure-min.css )
~~~~

2. Create a custom CSS file to include the CDN CSS in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

~~~~css
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require_tree .
*/
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/purecss@3.0.0/build/pure-min.css");
~~~~

3. Ensure that `application.css` is included in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

~~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>PurecssApp</title>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
  <%= csp_meta_tag %>

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbo-track': 'reload' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbo-track': 'reload' %>
</head>
<body>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
</html>
~~~~

4. Now restart the server

## Simple index.html

[index.html](/assets/purecss_index.html)

{{< include-html-code file="static/assets/purecss_index.html" >}}

**Note**: the piece of html code above is included in the page. The post by [Marcus Olsson](https://marcusolsson.dev/how-to-include-code-examples-from-file-with-hugo/) showed me how to do it.
