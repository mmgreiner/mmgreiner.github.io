[Pure.css] is a css framework that does not include JavaScript like other frameworks such as Vue, bootstrap, ...

In contrast to those frameworks:

>> Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at **3.5KB minified and gzipped**. Crafted with mobile devices in mind, it was important to us to keep our file sizes small, and every line of CSS was carefully considered. 

I like it because of its extremely simple usage, particulary for the small development web servers I'm working in *Ruby* or *go*.

I have only had some quirks with it when designing responsive menus for mobile devices. There is a [story on that]({{< relref "/post/2024-07-27-purecss-menu.md" >}}).

## Simple index.html

[index.html](/assets/purecss_index.html)

{{< include-html-code file="static/assets/purecss_index.html" >}}

**Note**: the piece of html code above is included in the page. The post by [Marcus Olsson](https://marcusolsson.dev/how-to-include-code-examples-from-file-with-hugo/) showed me how to do it.
