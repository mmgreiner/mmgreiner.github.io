A Swiss nick name for Markus is Küse, and since I love alliterations, this blog is called Küse’s Code.

It contains a collection of code snippets, mostly in the functional programming language [F#]({{site.fsharp_link}}). When it comes to web programming, [WebSharper]({{site.websharper_link}}) or [Bolero]({{site.bolero_link}}) are often used.

This blog was written as a static HTML site using [Jekyll]({{site.jekyll_link}}).
