A Swiss nick name for Markus is *Küse*, and since I love alliterations, this blog is called *Küse's Code*.

It contains a collection of code snippets, mostly in the functional programming language [F#](https://fsharp.org). When it comes to web programming, [WebSharper]({{site.websharper_link}}) is often used. 

This blog was written as a static HTML site using [jekyll][jekyll-organization]. You can find out more info about basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
